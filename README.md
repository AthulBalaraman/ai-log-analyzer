# 🛡️ AI Log Analyzer (Multi-Agent AI System)

## 🚀 Overview

This project is an **autonomous Multi-Agent AI-powered log analysis and response system** built using:

* LangChain (latest architecture)
* Google Gemini (LLM)
* FastAPI (backend)
* **Multi-Agent Orchestration (Planner, Executor, Supervisor)**

It not only analyzes logs but also **collaboratively plans, executes, and validates security actions** using multiple specialized AI agents.

## 🔥 Multi-Agent AI System (NEW)

### Architecture:

1.  **Planner Agent:** Analyzes the batch analysis results and creates a structured action plan in JSON format. It decides which IPs to block and what alerts to send.
2.  **Executor Agent:** A tool-calling agent that takes the plan and executes the necessary tools (`block_ip`, `alert_admin`, `log_incident`).
3.  **Supervisor Agent:** A lightweight validation layer that reviews the analysis and the actions taken to ensure they are appropriate and provides a final polished assessment.

### Why Multi-Agent:

*   **Better Decision Making:** Specialized agents focus on specific tasks (planning vs. execution), leading to more reliable outcomes.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Each agent has a clear role, making the system easier to debug and extend.
*   **Scalable Design:** New agents or tools can be added without bloating a single agent's logic.

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

*   **Real-world AI systems** are moving towards multi-agent architectures to handle complex workflows.
*   Similar to frameworks like **CrewAI**, **AutoGPT**, and **Enterprise AI systems**, this project demonstrates how multiple LLM instances can collaborate to solve a problem.
*   It provides a robust foundation for building autonomous security operations centers (SOCs).

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* Python 3.10+
* LangChain (v1.2+ as per requirements)
* langchain-google-genai
* FastAPI
* Pydantic
* asyncio (parallel execution)
* Uvicorn

## 🔄 Application Flow

```text
Logs → Analysis → Planner → Executor → Supervisor → Response
```

Detailed Flow:
1.  **Logs** are received via FastAPI.
2.  **LLM Analysis** classifies each log in parallel.
3.  **Planner Agent** creates a JSON plan of action.
4.  **Executor Agent** calls tools based on the plan.
5.  **Supervisor Agent** validates the results and provides a final summary.
6.  **Final Response** is returned to the client.

## 🚀 Example Request & Response

### Request:
```json
{
  "logs": [
    "Failed login attempts from IP 192.168.1.10",
    "SQL injection attempt detected on /api/users"
  ]
}
```

### Planner Output (Internal):
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {"action": "block_ip", "ip": "192.168.1.10"},
    {"action": "alert_admin", "message": "Multiple high-risk attacks detected: Brute Force and SQL Injection."},
    {"action": "log_incident", "details": "Blocked IP 192.168.1.10 and alerted admin regarding SQLi."}
  ]
}
```

### Final Response:
```json
{
  "overall_risk": "High",
  "average_confidence": 95.0,
  "total_logs": 2,
  "analysis": [...],
  "plan": [
    {"action": "block_ip", "ip": "192.168.1.10"},
    {"action": "alert_admin", "message": "..."},
    {"action": "log_incident", "details": "..."}
  ],
  "actions_taken": [
    "Blocked IP 192.168.1.10",
    "Admin alerted: Multiple high-risk attacks detected...",
    "Incident logged: ...",
    "Supervisor Assessment: The security response was appropriate. Both threats were neutralized and documented."
  ]
}
```

## 🛠️ Tools (Agent Capabilities)

* **block_ip(ip)** → Blocks malicious IP addresses.
* **alert_admin(message)** → Sends critical alerts to administrators.
* **log_incident(details)** → Records security events for auditing.
